rfc5766-turn-server for Debian
------------------------------

1) The turnserver has reasonable default option values and can work in many 
simple environments without extra configuration. But more complex meaningful 
usage requires setting options specific to your particular environment. 
For example, WebRTC requires long-term credentials and some extra stuff. 
To set the turnserver parameters:

	a) Edit /etc/turnserver.conf file.

	b) For user accounts settings, if using the turnserver 
	with authentication: edit /etc/turnuserdb.conf 
	file, or set up PostgreSQL or MySQL or Redis database for user accounts.
	Use /usr/share/rfc5766-turn-server/schema.sql as SQL database schema,
	or use /usr/share/rfc5766-turn-server/schema.userdb.redis as Redis 
	database schema explanation for the user authentication data, and 
	(optionally) use /usr/share/rfc5766-turn-server/schema.stats.redis as 
	Redis database schema explanation for status and statistics data.

2) You can start/stop the turnserver "manually", using the "/usr/bin/turnserver" 
   executable with appropriate options (see the documentation).
   If you want the turnserver to be an automatically started system service, 
   then you have to uncomment line "TURNSERVER_ENABLED=1" in 
   the /etc/default/rfc5766-turn-server file.
   
3) To create database schema, use schema in file 
   /usr/share/rfc5766-turn-server/schema.sql.
   
4) For additional information, run:
 
   $ man turnserver
   $ man turnadmin
   $ man turnutils

5) During installation, no TURN user accounts are created.  
rfc5766-turn-server does not recognise UNIX accounts and requires accounts 
to be defined in it's own config file. By default, TURN server uses anonymous 
access. 

Traditional STUN doesn't require an account. For TURN relay
purposes, several accounting options are possible:
	  - anonymous access (the default option);
	  - traditional long-term credentials mechanism (see RFC5766);
	  - TURN REST API shared-secret-based long-term credentials mechanism
	    (see TURN REST API docs);
	  - short-term authentication mechanism (see RFC5766);

If you are installing the TURN server for WebRTC usage, then you must set 
the long term credentials mechanism option and add user accounts - 
either with the flat config userdb file, or with PostgreSQL 
database, or with MySQL database, or with Redis database. Optionally,
you can add TURN REST API on top of long-term credentials mechanism.

Please see the README.* files for details.
